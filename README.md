## Hi, I'm Angelica ðŸ‘‹

I'm soon to be a qualified Front-End Developer with previous experience in quality and environmental certifications. As a person, I like problem-solving, when things are structured and organized and I get big professional pride in my assignments. Development is part of my passion therefore I see new knowledge as an interesting challenge.
